      <p>Nutritional Value: Fish is a highly nutritious food source. It is rich in high-quality protein, essential omega-3 
        fatty acids, vitamins (such as vitamin D), and minerals (like iodine and selenium). Consuming fish is associated with 
        various health benefits, including improved heart health and brain function.Main1</p>

    <section class="sub-section">      
      <p>Economic Impact: The fish industry plays a significant role in the global economy. It provides employment 
        opportunities for millions of people worldwide, from fishermen and fish farmers to those involved in processing, 
        distribution, and marketing. It contributes to income generation and economic stability in many regions.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="sub-section">      
      <p>Food Security: It helps enhance food security by providing a reliable and affordable protein source, especially 
        for coastal and island communities.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="sub-section">       
      <p>Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Fish farming (aquaculture) is often considered more environmentally 
        sustainable than other forms of livestock farming. Compared to cattle or poultry farming, aquaculture 
        generally has a lower carbon footprint and requires less land and freshwater resources.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="sub-section">       
      <p>Biodiversity Conservation: Sustainable fishing practices promote the conservation of marine ecosystems and the protection of 
        endangered species. Efforts to manage fish stocks and prevent overfishing contribute to the preservation of biodiversity in the oceans.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="sub-section">      
      <p>Export Opportunities: Fish and seafood products are often exported to international markets, contributing to a country's 
        foreign exchange earnings. This trade provides valuable income and helps balance trade deficits.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="sub-section">      
      <p>Low Carbon Footprint: Wild-caught fish generally have a lower carbon footprint compared to other animal protein sources like beef or lamb. 
        This is because fish often require less feed and space, and they produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions per kilogram of meat produced.</p>
